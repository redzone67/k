@Peter Robinson:
The Federal Reserve System, charged for more than a century now with maintaining price stability, with fighting inflation. How's the Fed doing? Our guest today is here to say, not as well as it should be. Kevin Warsh on Uncommon Knowledge, now. 

Welcome to Uncommon Knowledge. I'm Peter Robinson. A native of upstate New York, Kevin Warsh earned his undergraduate degree at Stanford and his law degree at Harvard. Mr. Warsh spent the early years of his career on Wall Street and in Washington. 

In 2006, President George W. Bush appointed him to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, where he served until 2011. Note that Mr. Warsh was on the Fed during the financial crisis of 2008, the worst financial crisis in more than half a century. 

Mr. Warsh now divides his time between New York, where he works in an investment firm, and Stanford, where he is a fellow here at the Hoover Institution. Kevin, welcome back to Uncommon Knowledge. 

@Kevin Warsh:
 It's great to be back. You hid the most important thing, which is the investment firm I happen to work for, the greatest investor in the history of the world, a guy named Stan Druckenmiller. But you were trying to keep that discreet. I appreciate that. I just wanted to boast about my friend and partner. 

@Peter Robinson:
You keep going because I want him to appear on the show sooner or later. We'll start buttering him up right now. 

All right, Kevin, here's the first question. Created a century and a decade ago, the Federal Reserve is the one institution in the nation charged with maintaining the value of our currency, the dollar. 

Two quotations. The late legendary investor Charlie Munger, quote, destroy the currency and God knows what will happen. 

Here's the second quotation. This comes from your remarks this past April to an organization of bankers called the Group of 30. And I've plucked from it a few of your descriptions of the Fed today. 

Financial drift, failure to satisfy its statutory remit, contributed to an explosion of federal spending, outsized role, and underperformance. 

Kevin Warsh, you are attacking a sacred institution, the institution on which every one of us depends every single day for the integrity of the money we make and the money we spend. What do you think you're doing? 

@Kevin Warsh:
In central banking, we are taught to keep our criticisms quite closeted. So I didn't do a very good job of that. In those same remarks, Peter, I described this as a love letter more than a cold critique. You might not have taken it as the love letter. I'm not sure the current incumbents did. 

@Peter Robinson:
I left the lovey-dovey stuff drop. 

@Kevin Warsh:
It's a love letter because the institution's as important as your setup would suggest. It's a love letter because if the institution can reform itself, then there can be great things for the institution and the country. But it does mean that it's time to get things back on track. 

I should say one other thing. This is our third experiment at a central bank in the United States. And it's our third experiment not because the first two went so well, they went poorly. This isn't like winning a third Super Bowl, Peter, where, you know, the more you get, the better. 

And the first two failed because they lost the consent of the governed. They lost their ability to deliver on what they promised. And this isn't a history lesson, but you can think about the Jacksonians of prior times, say that central bank seems like they're trying to focus and they're all preoccupied with those special interests on the East Coast. And they've lost track of what's happening to us in the center of the country. 

It's a version of what worries me today. And so this central bank's going on more than 100 years. And if they reform themselves, they're gonna have another great 100. Absent that, I worry. 

@Peter Robinson:
All right. So I want to return to your remarks in a moment, but first, take me through, I'm a layman in these matters. You're a skilled central banker and investor. You know this world. I don't. So take me through. I've got a couple of very elementary questions. 

Give me a moment to set up this question. The Federal Reserve System is established in 1913, possesses the power. This may be something of a oversimplification, but it possesses the power to set interest rates and regulate the money supply in the interest of achieving price stability. Those are big powers. 

How has it been doing? 

These are remarks by Milton Friedman, Nobel Prize winning economist, Milton Friedman in 1994, quote, there is no institution in the United States that has such a high public standing and such a poor record of performance. 

The Federal Reserve began operations in 1914 and presided over a doubling of prices during World War I. It produced a major collapse in 1921. The major villain in the Great Depression was unquestionably the Federal Reserve System. Since that time, it has presided over a doubling of prices since World War II. It financed the inflation of the 1970s. The Federal Reserve System has done far more harm than good, and I have long been in favor of abolishing it, close quote. 

Kevin, why do we need the Federal Reserve System? 

@Kevin Warsh:
So... None of this is new to you. Milton Friedman was here at Stanford when you were an undergraduate. So Milton, I was blessed to be a student of his, and when he came here, he had a huge effect on not just me, but generations of students that followed. 

I've spent some considerable time in the archives of the Hoover Institution looking at what Milton would say, for example, the Federal Reserve Chairman. There's a beautiful book by our own Jennifer Burns that includes some of that correspondence, but I had them search and give me all the letters that went back and forth between Paul Volcker and Milton Friedman and Alan Greenspan. 

@Peter Robinson:
Okay. So give us the dates. Volcker is appointed Fed Chairman by Jimmy Carter in 78, 77-ish? 

@Kevin Warsh:
In the middle of the Carter administration. I don't have the precise date. 

@Peter Robinson:
And then Ronald Reagan reappoints him, and he serves until nearly the end of the Reagan administration, correct? 

@Kevin Warsh:
Correct. 

@Peter Robinson:
And then Alan Greenspan succeeds him and serves until... 

@Kevin Warsh:
He served 17 years until Ben Bernanke shows up. In the middle of the crisis. 

@Peter Robinson:
In 2006. 2006, preceding the crisis, sorry. 

@Kevin Warsh:
The only reason why I know that is I recall being a junior White House staffer when I found out that not only had Chairman Bernanke, who had come to the White House from the Federal Reserve, and was going back to serve the big shoes of Alan Greenspan, but he wanted me to come with him and take his old job as Fed Governor. So I remember that. 
@Peter Robinson:
You remember that. 

@Kevin Warsh:
I remember that date. All right. Okay. But to Milton. And in that correspondence of Milton, the thing that's amazing about him is he was constantly revisiting his priors. He was constantly asking whether the data and conclusions he came to one year were still relevant the next, whether his judgments on institution were still relevant the next. 

And in much of the correspondence during the Volcker years and the Greenspan years, he was quite comforted by changes in approach, by new ways of thinking about the economy, by success that would come to be known as the Great Moderation. 

So I wouldn't say that Milton thought that the Federal Reserve was a terrible institution. He thought they had bad periods and good. I can only speculate what he would say about the great inflation of the last half a dozen years and how he would have foreseen it. He would have warned of it. And in all likelihood, the Fed wouldn't have listened. 

@Peter Robinson:
All right. So one more of these elementary questions, and again, Milton Friedman. Milton Friedman was famous for saying, quote, inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. Now, if inflation is a monetary phenomenon and the Fed is in charge of the money supply, inflation is always the fault ultimately of the Fed. Why don't you describe what Paul Volcker did? 

When Carter appointed Volcker, you'll know this, I'm just grasping at memories here. When Carter appointed Volcker, I believe we were suffering the highest inflation since the Civil War. And by the time Paul Volcker left office, inflation was right down to 2% or thereabouts. Almost. 

@Kevin Warsh:
Almost 2%. 

@Peter Robinson:
So, okay. So Milton Friedman and the Fed is always responsible? 

@Kevin Warsh:
Yeah. So I believe what Milton and you just channeled, which is inflation is a choice. As you said at the beginning of this setup, inflation and ensuring price stability was granted to the Federal Reserve by the Congress, most recently in a review of its statutes in the 1970s, so that there would be one agency that would be responsible for prices. 

No more blaming the other guy. We're giving the baton to you, the central bank, go after it and get it. Now, you wouldn't know from recent commentary of the last several years that inflation were a choice. 

In fact, during the run-up to the Great Inflation last five or six years, what did we hear about the causes of inflation? It was because of Putin in Ukraine. It was because of the pandemic and supply chains. 

Well, Milton would be outraged to hear that, and in my own subtle way, I was troubled to hear it as well. 

Those things lead to a change in prices. After all, in a market economy, the prices change in Walmart every day. That's how the market economy works. It's not the central bank's role to police those prices, but that's not what inflation is. 

That's a one-time change in the price level of a widget. Inflation is what happens if that one-time change in the price level becomes self-fulfilling. That is, higher prices beget higher prices. 

That means inflation ends up finding its way into every kitchen table and every boardroom because you don't know, as a decision-maker, what the price level is going to be. 

That's not about Putin and the pandemic. That's about the Federal Reserve. That's about the central bank. 

And I'm afraid, in recent years, this is probably because central banks are part of our culture, as we do a little bit of, well, it's not my fault, it's someone else's fault. And I think that's what Milton would be most outraged by in recent times. The central bank can hit any price level that it wants, any inflation level that it wants. 

We might not like how they do it, but the idea that is they should be blaming someone else strikes me as quite antithetical to good economic history. 

@Peter Robinson:
And it's, for the remainder of our conversation, it's probably important just to repeat, not only is inflation a choice, but a sound dollar is also a choice, and Volcker did it. In living memory, it has been done. We suffered inflation, and then the Fed got it back under control. All right. One more of these baby questions. 

@Kevin Warsh:
If I might?  So they got it back under control, and then I suspect, this is a little psychobabble from an economist, then they got complacent about inflation being under control, somehow after the period of what we call the Great Moderation, where prices were more or less stable for a period of more than a generation. I think some in my profession thought this was easy, and in fact, that it was under control because we had all gotten so very good at this, we'd all gotten perhaps a little complacent with this business, but economics isn't that easy, and it's really because of the most recent crises of 08 and 2020 that I suspect we took our eye off the ball. 

@Peter Robinson:
You've used this phrase a couple of times now. Let's just define it. The Great Moderation, I'm asking, it begins by the mid-'80s when Volcker and the Fed backed, let it be said by Ronald Reagan, when they actually get inflation down into low, low single digits, and inflation stays right there, and the economy expands with only a couple of quarters of recession for the next quarter of a century until the crisis of 2008. Am I right about that, and is that what you're referring to as the Great Moderation? 

@Kevin Warsh:
That's exactly right. I don't want to sound as though, boy, every year was perfect and central bankers didn't make any mistakes, but the mistakes were relatively small and manageable. And for viewers, I think, you know, inflation is still this very abstract concept. 

We want the change in prices to be such that in the economy, such that no one's talking about it. That's how we know we've done our job. And what do we know about the last five or six years? It's almost everything anyone will talk about. Right. 

@Peter Robinson:
Last of my elementary questions here, gold. President Nixon takes us off the gold standard in 1971. Until then, the dollar was always convertible into a fixed weight of precious metal, for the most part gold, and that constrained the money supply. 

The journalist and investor James Grant writing just last year, the opposite of the gold standard, what we have in place now, the opposite of the gold standards is really the system in place today in the United States. One might call it the PhD standard. 

It's the system of discretionary manipulation of interest rates by doctors of economics, close quote. So James Grant suggests, if not gold, some fixed basket of commodities. Milton Friedman said about the same time that he, of the quotation I gave you where he said he long stood for abolishing the Fed, that the Fed should be replaced with a pre-announced increase in the money supply by a fixed sum that would take place each and every year. 

So it was totally transparent markets. You could plan a decade in advance. And both of those are a way of saying, let's find some objective standards here. Let's find some way of constraining the money supply that the markets can know about in advance and not leave it all to the subjective impulses and the groupthink and the who really understands that econometric latest piece of research that takes place in the Federal Reserve System now. To which Kevin Warsh replies, 

@Kevin Warsh:
There is no status quo ante to return to. I have many of our friends on the right who believe, well, let's just bring the gold standard back. The world has moved on. Might it have been better or worse had we made different choices along the way? But you have to deal with what's right in front of you. I think that's what Orwell said. 

And there has to be a third choice between let's let the machine do it and let's have full discretion of a central banker's latest whims. 

I think you and I might have learned from Edmund Burke of conservatism. It's a resistance to whims. We central bankers past and present need to resist whims. There's a way to have clarity about the reaction function of central banks to incoming information. And if Milton were with us today, I hesitate to put words in the great man's mouth, but I think he would say that there had been too much scientism, scholasticism, trying to make precise that which we have still imperfect understandings of. 

Most of us in economics that are, I'd say, better than average, we try to focus to the left of the decimal point, not to the right of the decimal point. 

Now, if we were better at our craft, if we were smarter, we'd be physicists and mathematicians. And most of us that are in this business, we started in one of those fields and then we came to economics because, frankly, it was easier. 

And so we don't have a perfected understanding of how the economy works. If we did, we could create the machine. We could create the formula. But the economy is changing every day. It's incredibly dynamic. 

And so I hesitate to say we have a perfected rule. 

@Peter Robinson:
All right. Now we'll move on to recent history, your recent history and the Fed's recent history. What the financial crisis wrought. You were on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors during the financial crisis of 2008, which led to the worst economic contraction since the Great Depression and unemployment in this country of 10 percent. 

@Kevin Warsh:
Are you drawing a causal relationship there, Peter? I'm scared where the rest of this is going. 

@Peter Robinson:
You're just plain bad luck. The Fed responded with a number of actions, but perhaps the most dramatic was to flood the system with liquidity. 

Let me give you some sense of the magnitude of the Fed's action between the first and second quarter of 2008, the Fed's balance sheet, measure of the supply of reserves in the banking system, the balance sheet doubled in the space of a quarter from a trillion to two trillion.

Now, you've written that you strongly supported that decision. So before we get to the QE two, three, four, and so forth that I about what you're deeply scared or at least, well, you'll explain yourself in a moment. 

But first tell me why you supported that dramatic infusion of money into the markets in 2008. 

@Kevin Warsh:
Yeah. So, so first of all, we keep bringing up this word money. I should say a word about that. 

Milton believed, as you suggest, that monetary policy and inflation is about money. That is heretical in the modern academy. That is not taught in introductory to economics at most of these elite universities. 

Most came from a different school, not this monetary school, but more of a Keynesian school. And in that Keynesian school, money barely comes up. 

In fact, if you look at the transcripts of the Federal Reserve, they tape most of the words that we utter inside the Federal Open Market Committee. You're going to have to look a long time till you see that word money. I think money, strangely enough, has something to do with monetary policy. It has been absent from the discussion. 

I think it's part of the reason why this great inflation came back, because while Milton himself, I don't believe would have held exactly to the model he had in his mind 30 years ago. He would have said money has something to do with it. And in the run-up of the great inflation around the time of the COVID crisis, we saw a surge of money, both money as best we measure it and velocity as best we see it. 

@Peter Robinson:
So PVA equals MQ, I'm trying to remember back now to classes a long time ago. 
That's still, I would have thought that was basic in discussions at the Fed. 

@Kevin Warsh:
It is non-existent in most discussions among modern economists. Now Milton used to say, this is the last ode to Milton, and then we'll turn to current events. 

Milton, I was a 19 or 20 year old and there was a small group of us around the table a little larger than this. And I asked him some question, probably trying to show off that I knew something about something of which I didn't. 

And he said, Kevin, the only thing we understand in economics is econ one. Everything else is made up. And I remember thinking, Peter, you know, maybe the old man's losing it. Maybe he's sort of passed his day. You know, the Nobel Prize was given some period before that. 

I didn't know until the financial crisis of which you now speak that the old man was exactly right. No one predicted it. No one saw it. Because all we really know about economics, we teach in econ one. And at least in the econ one, before the schools of economic thinking took over at these elite departments, we said that money has something to do with monetary policy. I still believe that to be true. 

@Peter Robinson:
By the way, it occurs to me that as we sit here today, it's getting up toward 20 years ago that the financial crisis hit. So why don't you take just a moment to just explain what that felt like. 

You're on the phone to friends in New York. You're in Washington at the time on the board of the Fed. How bad was it? What do we need to understand about that crisis? 

@Kevin Warsh:
So I teach on occasion in this business school, not far from where we're taping. And for years I would talk about the global financial crisis and they'd look at me and these students would have some recollection. Now they weren't exactly in business, but they remember how their parents would have come home or they remembered watching it on TV. 

Now when I talk of the global financial crisis, they had heard of it and I could have easily been talking about the Great Depression. So it was some time ago. 

How it felt to me is, you know, I was 35 years old and I had finally found myself to this august position because of President Bush and Ben Bernanke. And I was in this beautiful office and for about six or eight months life was grand. Someone would come in and put wood in the fire. Someone else would, you know, restock this little pitcher of ice water. And I thought things were good. Little did I know that was the calm before the storm. I would say it in retrospect, it was scarier than it felt at the time because we were in some ways in the bunker together. While I don't know if Ben Bernanke would at all be comfortable with what I said at the IMF G30 meeting a few weeks ago. He was a heck of a strong good battle commander. We were all in the bunker together and he was very open to a small group of people who could get around a table like this and fight about what's happening and why and he was quite open to heretical ideas. 

I wonder whether there's such permitted heresy in the profession or at the Central Bank these days, but in the darkest days of that crisis, which maybe we get a gentleman's bee for how we handled it. We could have done more sooner. We made plenty of mistakes. We had some successes too. 

The real economy was deteriorating faster than we had any historical reference of. Financial markets were down 60, 70 percent in equity prices and maybe most alarming, the Treasury market auctions. The auction for the most important security in the world, which is synonymous with the dollar. People weren't showing up in the auctions, at least at the beginning. Bid-ask spreads were wide and we were worried that the American economic system was at the very cliff. 

@Peter Robinson:
So if I, my recollection, flooding the system with liquidity, pushing money out into the system was an emergency measure intended to keep the exchanges, to keep the markets functioning. On the theory that keeping the markets at work, keeping the markets open and functioning, giving people enough currency to be able to buy and sell was the best and most immediate thing that anybody could do. The markets themselves would gradually work this through, I suppose. Is that the justification? 

@Kevin Warsh:
So I'd say it goes back to first principles. Right. This third experiment of Central Bank, the one you referenced, the one that we're still living in, created in 1913, was created in 1913 in response to a panic that had preceded it less than a decade before. Central banks were first created, or this generation of central banks to respond to just this sort of situation. 

A panic in the old days, what we now call a deep recession, a financial crisis, is when markets aren't working, when there are spreads between what buyers are willing to play and sellers are willing to sell. 

And the job of the Central Bank is to show up with all sorts of money, there's that dirty word again, and get those markets to function. Not to set prices, but to make sure that buyers and sellers could clear. And the Central Bank was there to provide liquidity when no one else would. 

We were the backstop and are the backstop to the banking system, not just in the U.S., but in the rest of the world. Because if we blew it, it would have been even worse for the rest of the world. 

So that's what we did in crises. And, you know, some of your and my friends on the right, including at institutions we care deeply about, their views then were you should let the system burn down. A phoenix will rise from the ashes. You really have no business in doing this. That's not my view. 

My view is the Central Bank was created to respond to panics. We had one. We recognized it belatedly, but then we showed overwhelming force. And the word you used, I think, is the right word. It was an emergency. 

You're prepared to cross more lines than you would in benign times. You're prepared to, in some sense, as Paul Volcker famously said, then, go to the very edge of your authority. 

But there was an implicit promise we made to each other around the table that we made to the Treasury Department, the Congress, and I would broadly say to the rest of the U.S. government. 

When the crisis ends, we'll get out of this. We will go back to being a rather boring Central Bank. That's on page B12 of the newspaper. Six little paragraphs. The Fed met today and they raised or cut interest rates a quarter of a point. 

But from that moment until this moment, the Central Bank became front page news. And I will argue, played a bigger role than our founders would have been comfortable with. And the founders of a central bank should be comfortable with. 

@Peter Robinson:
All right. Let's go through then from 2008 to the present. And we have, I'm sure I'll get this wrong. So correct me. Let me go through it quickly. 

QE1. QE stands for quantitative easing, which is a fancy way of saying pushing money into the system. QE1 takes place in 2008. We've just discussed that. The Fed's balance sheet goes from just under a trillion to just over two trillion. Kevin's in favor of that one. 

QE2 takes place in 2010. The Fed's balance sheet rises to just under three trillion. 

QE3 takes place in 2012. The Fed takes its balance sheet up to four trillion. 

QE4 takes place in 2020 during the COVID lockdown, which will require a moment or two of discussion because that was an emergency. 

Toward the end of COVID by 2022, its balance sheet is up to nine trillion. 

Since then, the Fed has brought it back down to seven trillion. But as you have noted, the Fed's balance sheet today is almost an order of magnitude larger than it was when you joined the Fed within living memory in 2006. Okay. We've discussed QE1, QE2, QE3, the pre-COVID expansions of the money supply. 

@Kevin Warsh:
You know, you keep printing a trillion here and a trillion there. It's going to catch up to you, Peter. I mean, back in your day in Washington and in my day, various parts of the economic institutions would spend millions on this project or billions on that. 

We are a big and strong economy. We can tolerate these sorts of things, even if these projects aren't perfect. 

But when the Federal Reserve prints trillions, especially in benign times, it changes everything and it almost is a signal to the rest of Congress, we're doing it and so can you. So let's just go back to the essence of quantitative easing for a moment. 

QE1, which, by the way, at the time we tried to market it, this worked for about a week as credit easing. That was our preferred nomenclature. QE sort of took off without us. 

And what did we say then? We debated internally whether to do this. And the story goes something like this, Peter. Secretary Paulson, he's issuing bonds on Monday and Tuesday. What do you say we buy them on Thursday and Friday? A

nd I don't believe in betraying the confidences of those that were sitting around tables. But I recall one person saying, well, that sounds like a Ponzi scheme. What else do you have to save us from the global financial crisis? 

Explanations were given. Small versions of this were done by the Bank of Japan about a decade prior, but nothing quite like this. And we weren't quite sure how it would work, but it turns out it worked. And it was radical at the time. Now, if you turned economic textbooks, even introductory economics, they talk about this as like standard operating procedure. It seemed like a roll of the dice then, but we were in roll of the dice time. So we took it. 

But that was QE1, I supported it, and I supported it with many colleagues under the view of we're going to put this very dangerous, risky stuff back behind the covered glass until there's another crisis. We really never did that. 

The story you are going to tell about the subsequent QEs during a period that I would say was reasonably strong growth, reasonably stable financial markets, reasonable periods of stable prices. We started doing it for all seasons and all reasons. And in so doing, we raised the bar for when another crisis hits because whatever you were doing couldn't possibly be enough. 

I should only note one other thing, you're cleansing my biography and I should be grateful. I resigned. When QE2 was launched. In 2010, you recall. I left in early 2011. My colleagues, including Chairman Bernanke, who I mentioned for whom I had great respect as a war fighter, he and my colleagues at the Fed decided that we should keep on doing it. 

@Peter Robinson:
On what grounds? If you could make the best argument for their case that you could, what would the argument be? 

@Kevin Warsh:
So, we don't see any costs. We have found a free lunch. Look around, asset prices are higher. Markets are filled with more liquidity. The economy is good. And gosh, if we take it away, we don't know what would happen. And in some sense, they broke, in my view, the bargain that was struck. 

Did any of us know what would happen under various scenarios? No. Because again, in economics, unlike in physics, there are no control groups, at least no very good ones. And I should say the other thing that's different between economics and physics and math is the atoms that we're tracking in economics, they change their minds. So we don't know how individuals are going to react to a whole range of things. But the argument was the costs are small, the benefits are large, let's keep doing more of the same. 

@Peter Robinson:
All right. QE4 takes place during COVID. Economist Paul, I'm sure I'm going to mispronounce his name, Paul Shard in 2021, quote, with government suppressing economic activity to quell the pandemic, fiscal policy needs, he's writing during the pandemic, needs to play a significant social insurance role by providing income support to households and small businesses. 

And the more that monetary policymakers show their determination to achieve their inflation target by implementing aggressive QE policies, flooding the system with still more liquidity, the more credibility they will have when it comes to fighting inflation. Close quote. 

Kevin? 

@Kevin Warsh:
Much to unpack in that quote. So when you're in a crisis like the 2008 crisis and like the pandemic crisis, you know, I used to be known for saying when you've seen one financial crisis, you've seen one financial crisis. So none of them are terribly similar. But again, if you had imported my mind into the 2020 pandemic, I was here in the cheap seats at Stanford and in New York, I would have said, well, this is a time where we have to be radical. 

But the problem is between... 

@Peter Robinson:
Another emergency. 

@Kevin Warsh:
Another emergency. Right. But we didn't have an emergency for most of the decade between 2010 and 2020. This was the time for the central bank to retreat. Instead, the central bank stayed on the front pages. And I should also note during that period of a relatively benign period of relative peace and prosperity, Congress said, well, if the central bank are buying all the bonds, then we can spend trillions. 

Hence the fiscal authorities, Congress and the president decided there are very few costs to all of this spending because the Federal Reserve is subsidizing it because we were the most important purchaser of these bonds. And when you find your way into crisis, yes, I have sympathy for my colleagues in crises due to crisis-like things. 

But if you treat every day for more than a decade like it's a crisis, then when the actual crisis hits, you have to cross more lines. You have to get more involved in the private sector. And in so doing, to go back to where you began, you have an economic institution that isn't the first among equals. It's the first and most important institution in the world. 

And you see administrations, Republican and Democrat. 

@Peter Robinson: 
It's unelected bankers. 

@Kevin Warsh:
And you see members of Congress. And importantly, you see businesses. They now hire lobbyists to go to the central bank seeking relief. This is ahistorical. This is, in my view, dangerous. 

It takes the responsibility and accountability of fiscal policy and brings it to the central bank. And while my colleagues are well-intentioned folks and they might even make some good judgments, many of these things aren't their job. 

@Peter Robinson:
Kevin, let me respond on behalf of the Federal Reserve. Yes, yes, yes, yes, everything you said. But here's where we are today. Inflation is now below 2.5% and the economy is growing in spite of it all. 

And so instead of chiding the Federal Reserve, you should be saying, ladies and gentlemen, well done. 

@Kevin Warsh:
Mission accomplished is a very dangerous thing for policymakers in Washington. And that was your attempt at mission accomplished. So let me say this. 

After most crises, Peter, after the 9-11 crisis, after the global financial crisis, there were a series of after-action reports, congressional scrutiny, blue-ribbon commissions. How did that happen? 

Well, after the great inflation, I'm still waiting for this. Instead, we've cleaned up matters somewhat, but the institution is still, in my view, in over its skis quite a bit and inflation is still above target. The Fed has said that they are doing a bit of an after-action report. They're looking at their objectives. They're going to come out with this report this coming August. 

I wonder whether their report will be up to the task of this great error. The prices of goods and services over the last five or six years are up more than 30%. 

Since the day before COVID, the federal government spending is up 63%. 

And five years ago, I don't remember thinking this is an august, efficient, well-run government. So there are consequences that we shouldn't just sweep under the rug. So I appreciate the snapshot. 

Things are much better, but there have been costs to this error and the costs are being felt by those that are the least well-off among us. 

@Peter Robinson:
You've already mentioned some of this, but I'd like to go to the damage the Fed has done explicitly. The Wall Street Journal, this is a remarkable thing on which I congratulate you. I've never seen it before, that the Wall Street Journal reprinted over here under your name, while you did it, excerpted and rewrote your remarks for a column for the Wall Street Journal, and then printed over here, the lead op-ed in the day's paper, commenting on your speech. 

A Nobel Prize is as nothing by comparison with appearing on both sides of the Wall Street Journal editorial page. 

So here's what the journal said. Federal debt as a proportion of GDP in 2006, when you joined the Fed, was about 34%. Federal debt as a proportion of GDP today is about 100, headed toward about 124%. 

And the journal quotes your speech, irresponsible spending surged, especially in the aftermath of the pandemic. I struggled to absolve the Fed of the nation's profligacy. Fed leaders encouraged government spending when times were tough, but didn't call for fiscal discipline at the time of sustained growth and full employment, close quote. 

And now I'm going to turn on you, Kevin, because up until now, I've been offering one little defense after another of the Fed's policy. Now I'm going to turn on you and say, the growth in federal indebtedness, as Neil Ferguson pointed out in a recent very arresting column, there is just no history of any government that finds itself paying more on debt service than it does on defense and remaining a great nation. 

Far, my friend, from sounding the alarm, you've been much too tepid in attacking the Fed. This is an outrage. 

@Kevin Warsh:
So now you have me defending the Federal Reserve. We've reversed roles. 

@Peter Robinson:
I'd like to see how you handle this one. 

@Kevin Warsh:
So I believe the Federal Reserve plays this critically important role. I believe the Federal Reserve is up to reform. Heal thyself is an important thing for all institutions. It is not too late, but they need to ask and answer big, hard, strategic questions instead of just sort of pushing these things under the rug. 

Congress deserves its own criticism for reckless, irresponsible spending made more, I would say, made acceptable because the Federal Reserve were buying those bonds in large part and signaling to the world when the Fed buys the bonds, what are we telling the world's investors? The water's warm, come on in, you should do it too. 

But plenty of blame should be given to presidents and to Congress for pushing big spending in periods of peace and prosperity. But it's incredibly dangerous. 

I'll make one final point. Irresponsibility runs in both directions. The connection between fiscal spending, that is what Congress does, and monetary printing, that's what the central bank does, when one of them is irresponsible, the other one tends to be irresponsible too. 

We tend not to see the harms that are done immediately. There are, as Milton famously said, long and variable lags, but there's no free lunches here. And I'll make one broader point. When the rest of the world, Peter, sees the most important economic institution in the world treating normal times like they're an emergency, they do the same. 

No one gives us a run for our irresponsibility. The rest of the world believed about the U.S. for a long time, well, we don't really like how they show up at these meetings of the G7 or G10 or G20 and sort of lecture us. 

But before the 08 crisis, you know what they thought, well, those Americans, they might be a bit abrasive, but they sure know how to run a banking system until we didn't. 

Then going into the COVID crisis, what did they think? Well, those Americans, they're different than we are, but they do seem to believe in federalism and liberty and human agency until we didn't. 

And then, well, that central bank, maybe we're being too tough on them, but they prevailed on and preside over a period of stable prices for 40 years. That's pretty good until we didn't. 

When these institutions keep losing on important things, the rest of the world is watching And the rest of the world is watching the central bank as we sit here today. And if the central bank can put its own house in order, hide itself from the front pages, encourage thereby the Congress to be more responsible on spending, well, then this can be the shining city on the hill again, can it? 

@Peter Robinson: 
Okay. So, Herbert Stein used to say that if something can't get the late Herbert Stein economist, and I think he was chairman of Nixon's Council of Economic Advisors, is that correct? 

@Kevin Warsh:
Yes. 

@Peter Robinson: 
All right. He was chairman of Nixon's Council, was he? 

@Kevin Warsh:
Not to my knowledge. 

@Peter Robinson: 
All right. So, the late economist Herb Stein used to say, if something can't go on forever, it won't. Here's the question. We've been running essentially a Ponzi scheme. The Fed, the Treasury puts bonds up for sale. The Fed buys them. This is as close to actually running a printing machine and printing money as you could possibly get.

And yet the world still buys T-bills. In other words, why haven't markets, why haven't world markets disciplined the United States of America? 

@Kevin Warsh:
So I want to be clear... 

@Peter Robinson:
Because it looks as though Ben Bernanke was right. It looks as though there is no price. 


@Kevin Warsh:
So that was Peter Robinson, our host, saying that this is a Ponzi scheme. That is not his... Peter Robinson That is not you. Peter Robinson That is not his guest. 

I'm referring to a debate we had in a private setting about how would this appear. I actually do believe the U.S. is, I'd rather have our cards than anyone else's in the world. 

I believe we are on the front end of a productivity boom. I believe that economic growth in the U.S. is the most important thing and could do a better job at defusing these liabilities than anything else. Just to give one simple statistic. 

The Congressional Budget Office in their latest report, full disclosure, I'm on a panel of economic advisors to that office. They pay no heed to what I say necessarily. 

They say that growth over the next 10 years will be 1.7 or 1.8% per year in the U.S. I think that... 

@Peter Robinson:
 Over the next what? 

@Kevin Warsh:
10 years. 

@Peter Robinson:
They have no idea. Excuse me, I'm not on your panel, but they don't know what growth is going to be over the next 10 years. 

@Kevin Warsh:
We don't know what it will be in the next 10 minutes. But I'm willing to take the over. No matter what our government does, it turns out that while not a birthright of the American citizenry, we're an incredibly productive society. 

Our government might be trying to fix prices because of QE over the last 15 years or so, but the American people will show a dynamism and adaptability in an agency that's impressive. If we could grow one percentage point more per year than the Congressional Budget Office forecast, which is like most, that would yield another $4.5 trillion of revenue into the federal government's coffers. 

Well, that's a great way to defease these liabilities, so it isn't too late. But to your question about if it can't go on forever, it won't... 

@Peter Robinson:
Where are the alarm signals in world markets? 

@Kevin Warsh:
I would say... 

@Peter Robinson: 
Or in our own markets. 

@Kevin Warsh:
We don't want to get to that tipping point where we see flashing yellow lights and flashing red lights. 

Again, because this economy is even now, I'd say, the best of the lot with the most promising moments, we can see things that are worrisome out there. But I wouldn't want to say that this isn't eminently fixable. But the longer we kick the can down the road, the closer we get to the tipping point. And the best way to avoid the tipping point isn't to get so close that we see it tip. 

@Peter Robinson: 
All right. So from a document published in March by the House Budget Committee, quote, in an attempt to eradicate inflationary pressures caused by Biden's deficit spending spree, the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023. 

Consequently, the average effective interest rate paid on the national debt doubled from 1.7% to 3.4%, and net interest costs rose from 352 billion to 881 billion. It's that 881 billion, which now means that we're paying more on debt service than we spend on the Pentagon, which is about 800 billion and change. 

So Kevin, the Fed still has a balance sheet of 7 trillion. How does it shrink that balance sheet? How does it claw money back in without raising it? In other words, we have to maneuver between Silla and Corruptus here. This is a terrible pickle. And members, current members of the Fed may say, Kevin, Kevin, yes, yes, yes. Don't you understand? We're doing the best we can. In other words, what's your agenda for reform that won't make matters worse? 

@Kevin Warsh:
Yes. Well, this might upset part of your audience, Peter. So this is a trigger warning. This is what people like you and I do on campus. I believe this administration inherited a mess, a fiscal and monetary mess, and it is incumbent on the administration to get out of it. 

No one said it would be easy. We didn't get into this mess overnight. We're not going to get out of it overnight. To make the numbers you said somewhat easier, I think, to understand, we were paying about a billion dollars in interest expense every day the day before COVID. We're now paying more than $3 billion per day in interest expense. 

None of that's going to strengthen the military or help the least well-off among us that is being squandered away. 

So what do I suggest? As you pointed out, and as you and I have discussed, but I'm not sure the economics profession believes this, there are two monetary policy instruments. 

One is setting of interest rates, and the other is this money we keep talking about. We call it QE. We call it the central bank's balance sheet. If we would run the printing press a little quieter, we could then have lower interest rates because what we're doing right now is we have all this money that's being flooded into the system, which causes inflation to be above target. That's the $7 trillion balance sheet you're talking about, an order of magnitude larger than when I joined the Fed. 

And at the same time, you have another monetary policy instrument, and that's interest rates. They don't work perfectly together. They're not perfect substitutes for each, but they're both monetary policy. 

And too many that are in the central banking business say, no, no, no, that balance sheet has nothing to do with monetary policy. 

Well, if it did when you were growing it, it should have something to do with the conduct of monetary policy when it's going the other direction. 

I think we have to be honest about these two instruments, and because I believe that growing the real economy is the more important piece for revenue, for fairness, for efficiency and growth. Because you have higher inflation caused by the bigger balance sheet, we want to shrink that. We can't do it overnight. 

We want the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve to come to some accord, much like the Treasury and the Federal Reserve came to in 1951. Who's responsible for what? Who's going to be managing interest rates? The Federal Reserve. Who's going to be handling fiscal accounts? The Treasury Department. We have blurred these lines about who's responsible. 

And when a president comes to power, his treasury secretary should be responsible for, as the fiscal authority, instead of blurring that over to the Federal Reserve, which only brings politics to the Federal Reserve, and I would say interrupts their normal ordinary course. 

In my judgment, we should be shrinking the central bank balance sheet, taking the Fed out of these markets unless and until there's a crisis, and in so doing, you'd have less inflation that way. You and I might call that a practical monetarism. I think that's what our intellectual heirs might be thinking about, intellectual teachers might be thinking about. And in so doing, you might actually be able to pull off lower interest rates, which matter more to the real economy than the balance sheet. 

@Peter Robinson:
All right, Kevin, let me ask you in closing here about two visions of the country. And let me set this up with, again, a couple of quotations. 

Here's you, Kevin Morsh, for about 40 years, this is beginning with the Great Moderation, so beginning in the mid-'80s, for about 40 years, Americans scarcely thought about changes in the price level. 

Things were working the way they should. You could take it for granted because intelligent, hard-working people permitted the rest of the country to get on with its business, correct? 

All right. 

Here is former Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, testifying on the financial crisis of 2008 before Congressman Henry Waxman, Greenspan, "I made a mistake in presuming that the self-interests of organizations, specifically banks, were such that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and equity." 

Coming from Alan Greenspan, who began his career as an Ayn Rand fan and was as deep a believer in free markets as you could ever encounter anywhere in America in the 20th or 21st centuries, that's a statement. 

Waxman says, "in other words, you found that your free market ideology was not working." Greenspan, "that's precisely the reason I was shocked because I had been going on for 40 years with very considerable evidence that it was working."

Okay. So here's one vision. 

Beginning with Fed chairman Paul Volcker and President Reagan back in the 1980s, we achieved low inflation, sound dollar, overall federal spending is low enough to permit the economy to grow. Indeed, it grows faster than federal spending. 

We've got, as George W. Bush comes into office and before new wars take place, as he comes into office, we're actually running, projected to run, for a couple of years we were projected to run a surplus. 

But it's over. The financial crisis changed the world, the COVID lockdown. We have over a decade now of fiscal irresponsibility and market distorting easy money. 

And now you have market professionals such as James Grant and Ray Dalio casting doubt on the whole monetary system and young entrepreneurs buying Bitcoin because they no longer trust the dollar. 

Kevin, something basic is over and it's irreparable. What do you make of that vision? 


@Kevin Warsh:
That's outrageous. I am not a quitter. The country is not a quitter. The country is on the verge of a productivity boom, in my view, that makes that productivity boom that you knew when you were sitting in the Oval Office helping as a scribe to the president, that's going to make the 1980s look like we can do it all over again. 

@Peter Robinson:
A.I., more than A.I.? So, give me your vision. Give me your vision of what can happen if we don't continue screwing it up. 

@Kevin Warsh:
Our government has done its level best now for more than 15 years trying to screw around and do harm to this economy, and we have failed miserably. 

In spite of our best efforts to undermine the United States and its role in the world, the 21st century can be America's century. 

We have real rivals, a G2 rivalry much like you once knew with the Soviets on the other side of the world. We have to take it very seriously, but boy, I'd much rather have our cards than theirs. 

The broad conduct of public policy doesn't have to be perfect. You and I could envision with colleagues around here what would make for perfect trade policy or regulatory policy or tax policy, but of course, perfection is not the necessary ingredient. 

We just need to make policy a little better than it is, move it directionally back towards something that makes good sense in monetary and fiscal policy, and the U.S. economy will boom. 

Now, there's a tendency among some of our peers to say, well, we should just do what Reagan did, but those days are behind us. 

Hayek, I think, famously said, the job of people like you and me is to take the ideas from the past and to restate them and rethink them in the minds of a new generation. And so, it's not going back to Reaganism. It's a new set of economic policies in a new world that can drive the American spirit, that can drive individual liberty and freedom, and importantly, they need institutions like the Federal Reserve to be restored to what they once were, which is important institutions that are on the sidelines most of the time and can come in in exigent circumstances. 

And in so doing, we'll have more fiscal responsibility, we'll have higher economic growth, and this new generation of technologies, I believe, started here, and the U.S. will be a huge beneficiary. 

It's not preordained, it's not a birthright, but I believe it's not only possible but likely. 

@Peter Robinson:
Two last questions, summary questions. The Fed does not need to be ripped up. It doesn't need to be smashed and rebuilt. It just needs to correct its present course. A few degrees, the aircraft carrier takes a while to adjust, but a few degrees will do the trick. Have I got that right? 

@Kevin Warsh:
Right. I think you do. The Fed doesn't need a revolution. It's had a revolution in the last decade. What it needs is some degree of restoration. 

Now, I know you're not a golfer, but I learned this from a famous golf course architect named Gil Hans. When he looks at these golf courses and he tries to think about how do I make them great Again, he says that he is inspired by their past but not bound by it, faithful to what the architects of that golf course, in this case, the central bank, had in mind, faithful to it, but don't have to literally recreate it. 

Again, this is just like we can't go back to Reagan regulatory policies or Reagan fiscal or tax policies. We can't go back to Reagan monetary policies. We can look back to an institution and try to restore its best elements and keep in mind how the world is changing. 

You made reference to Bitcoin, and I thought I heard a little bit of condescension that people are buying Bitcoin in these things. 

@Peter Robinson:
But doesn't it, Charlie Munger, this is two or three years before he died, Charlie Munger attacked Bitcoin. He called it evil in part because it would begin to undermine the Fed's ability to manage the economy. 

@Kevin Warsh:
Or it could provide market discipline, or it could tell the world that things need to be fixed. 

@Peter Robinson:
Bitcoin does not make you nervous. 

@Kevin Warsh:
Bitcoin does not make me nervous. I can hearken back to a dinner I had here in 2011 with someone who is another guest on your show. I won't say his name. 

Okay, I just did, Mark Andreessen, who showed me the white paper. That was the original white paper. I wish I had understood as clearly as he did how transformative Bitcoin and this new technology would be. 

Bitcoin doesn't trouble me. I think of it as an important asset that can help inform policymakers when they're doing things right and wrong. 

It is not a substitute to the dollar. I think it can often be a very good policeman for policy. 

And if I were to speak more broadly to what did Charlie Munger and others perhaps have in mind, there is a proliferation of securities that go under all sorts of names. 

Many if not most of them are not worth what they're might be being traded for. So what did Charlie say, and maybe his pal Warren say there's the innovators, the imitators, and the incompetents. 

They're real innovators that are happening in and around that new technology. And what I would try to impart towards businesses and bankers is that the underlying technology that Mark showed me in that white paper or tried to show me in that white paper, it's just software. It's just the newest, coolest software that will provide us an ability to do things that we could never have done before. 

Can the software be used for good and evil? Yes, both, like all software. So I don't cast dispersions like that. If there's a final point, it's these technologies are being built here. I don't just mean on Stanford campus, I believe in the United States. 

And the world's most talented engineers from China and Europe and everywhere, they come to the United States even now to try to build this stuff. And my view is by building it here, that gives us an opportunity to be more productive and create something very special over the next decade. 

@Peter Robinson:
Next question, Kevin, last question. You, back in Manhattan, you work with one of the great investors of the last half century, Stanley Druckenmiller, and you're known as a macro house. 

You're looking at large global trends. So you see, and I know you see in detail because I know that you've been to China over and over again to investigate matters on the ground in China. 

There we have China, which since roughly the very late 70s has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, built a modern economy. We now see growth in India, more openness to markets in India. It's lagging China, but it's coming on. 

We even see, I say even because for many, many decade after decade, these were viewed as trouble spots. But in Sub-Saharan Africa, there are signs of real economic growth in Nigeria and Kenya, among other places. 

Looking at all of that, aware of all of that, Kevin Warsh is still long the United States of America. 

@Kevin Warsh:
Absolutely. I'll say a couple of things if I can in closing about that. The U.S. is the innovator of almost all of these technologies. 
@Peter Robinson:
Now might they be used in other places? 
@Kevin Warsh:
Absolutely. The most talented people in the world still wanna come here. The most talented people that are in the United States wanna build here. Economic policy, I believe, is trending in a better direction over the last half year than it has been. Economic policy isn't perfect and it never will be, but the American people are ready to be liberated from the shackles they've been under. 

For all the policies that have been discussed around this table and others, we haven't mentioned the regulatory tax that has really done great harm to the U.S. economic growth over the course of the last decade. That tax is coming off. 

I believe in part, we've talked about this productivity revolution, we've talked in some sense about technology, but I think that humans are underrated, American humans in particular, and their ability to adapt to new technologies and thrive, I think is very real. 

This might sound Pollyannish to some of your listeners, but what we used to call the micro foundations of macroeconomics, which I will broadly translate in another trigger word, the culture of what's happening in the society, the willingness to take risks, fail and take risks again, they are still happening in the United States more than anywhere else. 

They're not happening in France and Germany at this rate. They're not happening in China at this rate because of their own governance issues. 

And it's an incredibly exciting time. As we take that regulatory tax away, as we restore some economic policies that have worked better before, as we're reforming institutions right now, I'm willing to take the upside of economic growth here, and I'm willing to bet that the central bank fixes matters that are broken, achieves price stability yet again, and the rest of the world might not love us. 

But once again, they're going to look at the US and say, in spite of some of the things we don't like, their economy is growing faster, and that's where we want to send our capital.

ピーター・ロビンソン：
100年以上にわたり、物価の安定、すなわちインフレと闘うことを任務としてきた連邦準備制度。FRBはうまくやっているのか。今日のゲストは「そうあるべきほどにはうまくいっていない」と語る。『Uncommon Knowledge』、ケビン・ウォーシュ、今始まる。

『Uncommon Knowledge』へようこそ。私はピーター・ロビンソン。ニューヨーク州北部の出身で、ケビン・ウォーシュはスタンフォード大学で学士号、ハーバード大学で法学位を取得した。ウォーシュ氏はキャリアの初期をウォール街とワシントンで過ごした。

2006年、ジョージ・W・ブッシュ大統領により連邦準備制度理事会理事に任命され、2011年まで務めた。ウォーシュ氏は、半世紀以上で最悪の金融危機であった2008年の金融危機の最中にFRBに在籍していた。

現在は、投資会社で働くニューヨークと、フーバー研究所のフェローを務めるスタンフォードの間で時間を分けている。ケビン、再び『Uncommon Knowledge』へようこそ。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
また戻ってこられてうれしい。あなたは最も重要な点を隠したね。私が働いている投資会社、つまり世界史上最高の投資家、スタン・ドラッケンミラーという人物のことだ。控えめにしてくれたのだろうが、ありがたい。ただ、友人でありパートナーである彼を自慢したかっただけだ。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
その調子で続けてくれ。いずれ番組に出演してもらいたいから、今からおだてておこう。

さてケビン、最初の質問だ。1世紀と10年前に設立された連邦準備制度は、国家で唯一、通貨、すなわちドルの価値を維持する責務を負う機関だ。

二つの引用を挙げよう。伝説的投資家チャーリー・マンガーの言葉だ。「通貨を破壊すれば、神のみぞ知る事態が起きる」。

二つ目は、今年4月、G30と呼ばれる銀行家団体で行った君の講演からの引用だ。現在のFRBについての表現をいくつか抜き出した。

金融的漂流、法定責務の不履行、連邦支出の爆発への寄与、過大な役割、そしてパフォーマンス不全。

ケビン・ウォーシュ、君は神聖な制度、我々全員が日々その貨幣の完全性に依存している制度を攻撃している。一体何をしているつもりだ。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
中央銀行の世界では、批判はなるべく内々にとどめるよう教えられる。だから私はあまり上手にそれを守れなかった。同じ講演の中で、私はそれを冷酷な批判というより「ラブレター」だと表現した。あなたはそう受け取らなかったかもしれないし、現職の人たちもそうではなかっただろう。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
愛情表現の部分は省いた。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
ラブレターなのは、この制度があなたの言う通り極めて重要だからだ。そして、制度が自ら改革できれば、制度にとっても国にとっても偉大な未来があるからだ。ただし、軌道修正の時が来ている。

もう一つ言っておきたい。これは米国における三度目の中央銀行の試みだ。最初の二つがうまくいったから三度目があるわけではない。うまくいかなかったからだ。スーパーボウルを三度制したという話ではない。

最初の二つが失敗したのは、被治者の同意を失ったからだ。約束した役割を果たせなくなった。歴史の授業をするつもりはないが、ジャクソン派の時代を思い起こせば、中央銀行は東海岸の特別利益にばかり気を取られ、国の中心部で起きていることを見失っている、と言われた。

それは、今日私が抱く懸念の一形態でもある。この中央銀行は100年以上続いてきた。もし自らを改革できれば、次の100年も偉大なものになるだろう。そうでなければ、私は不安を覚える。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
では、あなたの講演内容に戻る前に、基本的なところから確認したい。私はこの分野では素人だ。あなたは熟練した中央銀行家であり投資家だ。だから初歩的な質問をいくつかさせてほしい。

連邦準備制度は1913年に設立され、金利設定と通貨供給の調整を通じて物価安定を達成する権限を持つ。単純化して言えばそういうことだ。その巨大な権限はどう使われてきたのか。

それはどれくらい続いたのか。

ノーベル賞経済学者ミルトン・フリードマンの1994年の発言を引用しよう。「米国において、これほど高い公的評価を受けながら、これほど劣悪な業績を残してきた制度は他にない」。

FRBは1914年に業務を開始し、第一次世界大戦中に物価の倍増を招いた。1921年には大崩壊を引き起こした。大恐慌の主犯は疑いなく連邦準備制度である。その後も第二次世界大戦後の物価倍増、1970年代のインフレを資金面で支えた。FRBは善よりも害をもたらしてきた。私は長らく廃止を主張してきた。

ケビン、なぜ我々は連邦準備制度を必要とするのか。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
これはあなたにとって新しい話ではない。ミルトン・フリードマンは、あなたが学部生だった頃、ここスタンフォードにいた。私は彼の学生だったことを誇りに思っている。彼は私だけでなく、後に続く何世代もの学生に大きな影響を与えた。

私はフーバー研究所のアーカイブで、ミルトンがFRB議長について何を語っていたかを調べる時間をかなり費やした。ジェニファー・バーンズによる素晴らしい本があり、そこにはその往復書簡も含まれているが、私はポール・ボルカーとミルトン・フリードマン、アラン・グリーンスパンの間で交わされたすべての手紙を探してもらった。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
よし。では日付を教えてくれ。ボルカーはジミー・カーターにより1978年、77年ごろにFRB議長に任命されたのか。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
カーター政権の途中だ。正確な日付は覚えていない。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
それでロナルド・レーガンが再任し、レーガン政権のほぼ終わりまで務めた、で合っているか。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
その通りだ。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
それからアラン・グリーンスパンが後任になって、いつまで務めた。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
17年務めて、ベン・バーナンキが登場する。危機の途中で、だ。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
2006年だな。危機に先立つ2006年だ。すまない。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
その日付を知っているのは、私がホワイトハウスの若手スタッフだったときに、バーナンキ議長がFRBからホワイトハウスに来ていたのに、また戻ってグリーンスパンの大きな靴を継いで議長を務めることになったと知ったのを覚えているからだ。そして彼は、私に一緒に来て、彼が以前やっていたFRB理事の職を引き継げと言った。だから覚えている。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
覚えているわけだ。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
覚えている。_attach that date.（つまり、その日付は覚えている。）よし。だがミルトンに戻ろう。ミルトンの書簡で驚くべきなのは、彼が常に自分の前提を見直していたことだ。ある年に到達したデータや結論が翌年もなお妥当かどうか、制度に対する判断が翌年もなお妥当かどうかを常に問い直していた。

そしてボルカー期とグリーンスパン期の書簡の多くで、彼はアプローチの変化、新しい経済の捉え方、そして後に「グレート・モデレーション」と呼ばれる成功によって、かなり安心していた。

だから私は、ミルトンがFRBをひどい制度だと思っていた、とは言わない。彼は悪い時期と良い時期があると考えていた。ここ5〜6年の大インフレについて彼が何と言うか、どう予見したかは推測するしかないが、彼は警告しただろう。そしておそらくFRBは聞かなかった。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
よし。初歩的な質問をもう一つ。やはりミルトン・フリードマンだ。ミルトン・フリードマンは「インフレは常に、そしてあらゆる場所で、貨幣的現象だ」と言ったことで有名だ。もしインフレが貨幣的現象で、FRBが通貨供給を担当しているなら、インフレは究極的には常にFRBの責任ということになる。ではポール・ボルカーが何をしたかを説明してくれ。

カーターがボルカーを任命したとき、これは君も知っているだろうが、私は記憶を手繰っているだけだ。当時、我々は南北戦争以来の高インフレに苦しんでいたはずだ。そしてポール・ボルカーが退任する頃には、インフレ率は2％前後まで下がっていた。ほぼ、だが。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
ほぼ2％だ。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
よし。ではミルトン・フリードマンの言う「最終的にはFRBが常に責任を負う」という点についてはどうだ。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
そうだな。私は、今あなたがまさに代弁したミルトンの考えを信じている。それは「インフレは選択だ」ということだ。あなたが冒頭で述べた通り、インフレと物価安定の確保は、議会によって連邦準備制度に付与された。直近では1970年代に法定権限が見直され、価格について責任を負う機関を一つにした。

もう他人のせいにするな、ということだ。バトンをお前たち中央銀行に渡す。取りに行って、達成せよ。ところが、ここ数年の最近の論調を見れば、インフレが選択だとはとても思えない。

実際、ここ5〜6年の大インフレに向かう局面で、インフレの原因として何が語られたか。ウクライナのプーチンのせいだ、パンデミックとサプライチェーンのせいだ、という話だった。

ミルトンならそれを聞いて憤慨しただろうし、私も私なりに、それを聞いて心配になった。

それらは価格の変化をもたらす。結局、市場経済では価格は毎日ウォルマートで変わる。それが市場経済の仕組みだ。中央銀行の役割はそれらの価格を取り締まることではない。だがそれは「インフレ」ではない。

それは、ある部品（widget）の価格水準が一度だけ変わる、という話だ。インフレとは、その一度きりの価格水準の変化が自己実現的になることだ。つまり、価格の上昇がさらなる価格上昇を生む。

そうなると、意思決定者として価格水準がどうなるか分からないから、インフレはあらゆる台所の食卓にも、あらゆる役員会議室にも入り込む。

それはプーチンやパンデミックの話ではない。連邦準備制度の話だ。中央銀行の話だ。

そして残念ながら、近年は、おそらく中央銀行が文化の一部になっているせいで、「自分のせいではない、誰か他人のせいだ」というようなことが少し起きているのだと思う。ミルトンが近年で最も憤慨するのは、たぶんそこだ。中央銀行は、望むならどんな物価水準でも、どんなインフレ率でも実現できる。

やり方は気に入らないかもしれないが、他人のせいにするべきだという発想は、良い経済史とは相容れないと私は思う。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
そして残りの議論のために重要なのは、「インフレは選択である」だけでなく「健全なドルも選択である」という点を繰り返すことだろう。ボルカーはそれをやった。生きた記憶の中で、実際にやられたことだ。我々はインフレを経験し、そしてFRBはそれを再び制御下に戻した。よし。もう一つ、赤ん坊レベルの質問だ。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
もしよければ。だから彼らは制御下に戻した。その後、これは経済学者の心理学的解釈（psychobabble）だが、私はこう疑っている。いわゆるグレート・モデレーション、すなわち一世代以上にわたり物価が概ね安定していた時期の後、インフレが制御されていることに対して彼らは慢心したのではないか。私の職業の一部の人々は、これは簡単だと思い始めたのだろう。しかも、私たちはこれがうまく制御されているのは、私たちがこの仕事を非常にうまくやれるようになったからで、私たちはこの仕事において少し慢心したのではないか。しかし経済はそんなに簡単ではない。私は、2008年と2020年という直近の危機があったからこそ、我々は肝心なところから目を逸らしたのだと思う。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
君は何度かこの言葉を使った。定義しよう。グレート・モデレーションだ。私の理解では、1980年代半ば、ボルカーとFRBが、そして言っておくべきだがロナルド・レーガンによって支えられ、インフレを低い一桁にまで下げ、その後インフレはそこにとどまり、経済は次の四半世紀にわたり、数四半期の景気後退を数回挟むだけで拡大し続け、2008年の危機に至る。合っているか。君がグレート・モデレーションと呼んでいるのはそれか。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
まさにその通りだ。もちろん、毎年が完璧で、中央銀行家が一切間違いを犯さなかった、というように聞こえたくはないが、間違いは比較的小さく、管理可能だった。視聴者にとって、インフレはまだ非常に抽象的な概念だと思う。

我々が望むのは、経済における物価の変化が、誰もそれについて話さない程度であることだ。誰もそれについて話していない、ということが、我々が仕事をしている証拠だ。では、この5〜6年について何が分かるか。ほとんど誰もがそれについて話している、ということだ。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
初歩的な質問の最後だ。金だ。ニクソン大統領は1971年に金本位制から離脱した。それ以前、ドルは固定された重量の貴金属、主として金へと、ほとんどの場合で交換可能であり、それが通貨供給を制約していた。

ジャーナリストで投資家のジェームズ・グラントは昨年こう書いた。金本位制の反対、つまり現在の米国で機能している制度は、金本位制の反対物だ。これは「PhD本位制」と呼べる。つまり、経済学博士たちによる金利の裁量的操作の制度である、と。

だからグラントは、金でなくとも、商品バスケットなどの固定的な基準が必要だと示唆する。ミルトン・フリードマンもほぼ同じ頃に、私があなたに示した「FRBの廃止を長らく支持してきた」という引用と同じ頃、FRBは、毎年必ず一定額だけ事前に公表した通貨供給増加を実行するルールに置き換えるべきだと言った。

つまり完全に透明で、10年先まで計画できる市場だ。これらはいずれも、客観的な基準を見つけよう、事前に市場が知りうる形で通貨供給を制約しよう、そしてFRBの中で起きている主観的衝動、集団思考、最新の計量経済学研究を誰が本当に理解しているのかといったものに任せきりにするのはやめよう、という言い方だ。これに対し、ケビン・ウォーシュはどう答える。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
元に戻るべき「現状以前」というものは存在しない。私の友人の中には右派の人々も多く、「金本位制を復活させればいい」と考える人もいる。だが世界はすでに先に進んでいる。途中で別の選択をしていれば良かったのか悪かったのか、という議論はできるが、目の前にある現実に対処しなければならない。それがオーウェルの言葉だったと思う。

そして「機械にすべて任せる」ことと、「中央銀行家の気まぐれに全面的な裁量を与える」ことの間には、第三の選択肢があるはずだ。

あなたと私はエドマンド・バークから保守主義を学んだと思う。それは気まぐれへの抵抗だ。過去と現在の中央銀行家は、気まぐれに抗う必要がある。入ってくる情報に対して中央銀行がどう反応するか、その反応関数について明確さを持つことは可能だ。

もしミルトンが今日ここにいたら、偉大な人物の口に言葉を押し込むのはためらわれるが、彼はこう言うと思う。科学主義、スコラ哲学的態度が過剰になり、不完全な理解しか持っていないものを精密にしようとしすぎている、と。

経済学で平均以上の能力を持つ我々は、小数点以下ではなく、小数点の左側に焦点を当てるよう努める。もし本当に我々が優れているなら、物理学者や数学者になっていただろう。多くの人間は、最初はそうした分野から出発し、率直に言って、経済学の方が簡単だからこちらに来た。

だから経済の仕組みを完全に理解しているわけではない。もし完全に理解していれば、機械を作れたし、公式を作れた。しかし経済は毎日変化し、極めて動的だ。

ゆえに、完全なルールがあるとは言えない。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
では最近の歴史、あなた自身の最近の歴史とFRBの最近の歴史に移ろう。あなたは2008年の金融危機の最中にFRB理事会にいた。この危機は大恐慌以来最悪の景気後退を招き、失業率は10％に達した。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
そこに因果関係を引いているのか、ピーター。この先が怖い。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
単に運が悪かっただけだ。FRBはさまざまな対応を取ったが、最も劇的だったのはシステムに流動性を大量に供給したことだ。

2008年第1四半期から第2四半期にかけて、FRBのバランスシート、つまり銀行システムに供給される準備金の規模は、わずか1四半期で1兆ドルから2兆ドルへと倍増した。

あなたはこの決定を強く支持したと書いている。

そこで、QE2、QE3、QE4に進む前に、まず2008年にこのような大規模な資金供給を支持した理由を説明してほしい。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
まず「マネー」という言葉について一言言わせてほしい。

ミルトンは、あなたが示唆した通り、金融政策とインフレはマネーの話だと考えていた。これは現代の学界では異端だ。多くの一流大学の初級経済学では教えられていない。

多くは、貨幣学派ではなくケインズ派の流れから来ており、そのケインズ派ではマネーはほとんど登場しない。

実際、連邦公開市場委員会での発言記録を見ても、「マネー」という言葉を探すのに相当時間がかかる。奇妙なことに、金融政策にとってマネーは重要なはずなのに、議論から消えている。

これが大インフレ再来の一因だと思う。ミルトン自身は30年前のモデルをそのまま維持したとは思わないが、それでも「マネーは関係している」と言っただろう。COVID危機前後の大インフレの過程で、我々はマネー供給の急増を見た。測定可能なマネーも、観測される限りの貨幣流通速度もだ。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
MV＝PQだな。昔の授業を思い出そうとしている。

これはFRBの議論では基礎だと思っていたが。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
現代の経済学者の議論では、ほとんど存在しない。ミルトンがよく言っていた話がある。これでミルトンの話は最後にしよう。

私が19歳か20歳の頃、小さなテーブルを囲んで彼と数人で話していた。私は、たぶん自分が何か分かっているふりをしようとして、質問をした。

すると彼は言った。「ケビン、経済学で我々が理解しているのはエコン1（初級経済学）だけだ。それ以外は作り話だ」。

当時私は、「この老人は衰えたのではないか」と思った。ノーベル賞はずっと前に取っていたし。しかし、あなたが言及した金融危機を経て、彼が完全に正しかったことが分かった。誰も予測できなかった。誰も見抜けなかった。なぜなら、我々が本当に知っている経済学は、エコン1だけだからだ。そして少なくともかつてのエコン1では、マネーは金融政策に関係があると教えていた。私は今もそれを信じている。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
ところで、今日ここに座っていて気づくのは、金融危機からもう20年近く経とうとしているということだ。そこで少し、その当時の感覚を説明してほしい。

ニューヨークの友人たちと電話で話し、あなたはワシントンでFRB理事だった。どれほど深刻だったのか。我々は何を理解すべきなのか。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
私はこの近くのビジネススクールで時々教えている。何年も金融危機の話をすると、学生たちはぼんやりとした記憶を持っていた。親が帰宅して話していたのを覚えているとか、テレビで見たとかだ。

今では、金融危機の話をしても、彼らは聞いたことがある程度で、大恐慌の話をしているのと変わらない。私にとっての感覚は、後から振り返ると当時よりも怖かった、というものだ。なぜなら我々は一緒に壕の中にいたからだ。

ベン・バーナンキが私が数週間前にIMF・G30で言ったことを快く思うかは分からないが、彼は極めて強力で優れた司令官だった。小さなグループで激しく議論し、異端的な考えにも耳を傾けた。

今の職業や中央銀行に、ああした異端が許されているかは疑問だが、危機の最暗黒期において、我々はある程度うまく対処した。もっと早く、もっと多くできたかもしれないし、間違いも多かったが、成功もあった。

実体経済は、歴史的参照点がないほどの速さで悪化していた。株式市場は60〜70％下落し、最も憂慮すべきは米国債市場の入札だった。世界で最も重要な証券、ドルそのものと同義の市場で、人が集まらなかった。ビッド・アスク・スプレッドは拡大し、米国経済システムが崖っぷちにあると感じていた。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
私の記憶では、システムに流動性を洪水のように注ぎ込み、市場に資金を押し出したのは、取引所を、市場を機能させ続けるための緊急措置だった。市場が機能し続け、人々が売買できるだけの通貨を与えることが、誰にとっても最も即効性のある対応だ、という理屈だったと思う。市場自体が時間をかけて問題を処理していく、という発想だろうか。その理解で合っているか。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
第一原則に立ち返る話だ。この三度目の中央銀行の試み、つまり1913年に設立され、今も続いている制度は、その10年足らず前に起きたパニックへの対応として作られた。中央銀行、あるいはこの世代の中央銀行は、まさにこうした事態に対応するために生まれた。

昔で言うパニック、今で言う深刻な景気後退や金融危機とは、市場が機能していない状態だ。買い手が支払いたい価格と、売り手が売りたい価格の間に大きな乖離が生じる。

中央銀行の仕事は、あらゆる形のマネー、ここでもあの忌まわしい言葉だが、それを持って現れ、市場を機能させることだ。価格を決めることではなく、買い手と売り手が決済できるようにすることだ。誰も流動性を供給しないときに、それを供給するのが中央銀行だ。

我々は銀行システムの最後の貸し手であり、それは米国だけでなく世界にとってそうだ。もし我々が失敗していれば、世界にとってさらに悪い事態になっていた。

それが危機における我々の役割だ。そして、あなたや私の右派の友人の中には、「システムを燃やしてしまえ。灰の中から不死鳥がよみがえる。そんなことをする権限はない」という考えもあった。私はそうは思わない。

私の考えでは、中央銀行はパニックに対応するために作られた。我々はパニックに直面した。認識は遅れたが、圧倒的な力で対応した。あなたが使った言葉は正しい。それは緊急事態だった。

平時なら越えない一線を越える覚悟が必要になる。ある意味で、ポール・ボルカーが有名に言ったように、権限の限界まで踏み込む覚悟が必要だ。

だが我々は、テーブルを囲んだ者同士、財務省、議会、広く言えば米国政府全体に対して、暗黙の約束を交わした。危機が終われば、我々はここから手を引く。再び退屈な中央銀行に戻る、と。

新聞のB面12ページに載る、6段落の記事だ。「FRBは本日会合を開き、金利を0.25％引き上げ（引き下げ）た」。それで終わりだ。

しかし、その時から今日に至るまで、中央銀行は一面記事になり続けた。そして私は、創設者たちが快く思わなかったであろう、過大な役割を果たしてきたと主張したい。中央銀行の創設者自身も、そうした姿を良しとはしなかったはずだ。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
では2008年から現在までを整理しよう。間違っていたら訂正してほしい。手短に行く。

QE1。QEとは量的緩和のことで、要するに資金をシステムに押し込むことだ。QE1は2008年だ。これは今話した。FRBのバランスシートは1兆ドル弱から2兆ドル強へと膨らんだ。ケビンはこれを支持した。

QE2は2010年。バランスシートは3兆ドル弱へ。

QE3は2012年。4兆ドルへ。

QE4は2020年、COVIDのロックダウン中だ。これは緊急事態なので少し議論が必要だろう。

COVID終盤の2022年には、バランスシートは9兆ドルに達した。

その後、FRBは7兆ドルまで縮小したが、あなたが指摘しているように、現在のFRBのバランスシートは、あなたが2006年にFRBに加わった時と比べて、ほぼ一桁大きい。よし。QE1、QE2、QE3、COVID前の通貨供給拡大については話した。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
1兆ドル、また1兆ドルと刷っていけば、いずれツケは回る、ピーター。昔のワシントンでは、どこかの機関がこのプロジェクトに数百万、あのプロジェクトに数十億使う、という話だった。

我々は大きく強い経済だ。完璧でないプロジェクトでも耐えられる。しかしFRBが、特に平時に数兆ドルを刷ると、すべてが変わる。それは議会に対するシグナルにもなる。「我々がやっているのだから、君たちもやれる」と。

量的緩和の本質に戻ろう。QE1の時、当初は「クレジット緩和」と呼ぼうとしたが、1週間ほどで通用しなくなった。QEという言葉が定着した。

当時、我々は内部で激しく議論した。話はこうだ。財務長官ポールソンが月曜と火曜に国債を発行する。木曜と金曜に我々がそれを買うのはどうだ、という話だ。
＊＊＊
私は機密を暴露するつもりはないが、誰かが「それはポンジ・スキームのように聞こえる」と言ったのを覚えている。それ以外に世界金融危機を救う手段はあるのか、という空気だった。

説明がなされた。日本銀行が10年ほど前に小規模に似たことをやっていたが、規模も性質も違った。我々も、どう機能するか確信はなかったが、結果的に機能した。当時は過激だった。今では教科書に標準手法として載っている。

当時は賭けだったが、賭けに出るしかない状況だった。だからやった。私はQE1を支持した。だがそれは「危険でリスクの高い手段は、危機が去ればガラスケースの奥に戻す」という前提付きだった。我々はそれをしなかった。

その後のQEについてあなたが語ろうとしている話、比較的堅調な成長、安定した金融市場、安定した物価の時期にもQEを続けた。あらゆる季節、あらゆる理由でやるようになった。その結果、次の危機が来た時のハードルを引き上げてしまった。何をやっても足りなくなる。

もう一つ付け加えると、私の経歴をきれいにしてくれてありがとう。私はQE2が始まった時に辞任した。2010年だ。私は2011年初めに去った。バーナンキ議長を含む同僚たちは、続けるべきだと判断した。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
彼らの立場を最善の形で擁護するとすれば、どんな理屈だったのか。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
コストが見えない。フリーランチを見つけた、という考えだ。資産価格は上がり、市場は流動性で満たされ、経済は好調だ。これを引き揚げたら何が起きるか分からない。そうして彼らは、私の見方では、暗黙の合意を破った。

どのシナリオで何が起きるか、誰にも分からない。経済には物理学のような対照実験はない。しかも経済の「原子」は考えを変える。個人がどう反応するか分からない。だが彼らの主張は、コストは小さく、便益は大きい、だから続けよう、というものだった。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
ではQE4、COVID中の対応だ。2021年、経済学者ポール・シャードはこう書いた。政府がパンデミックを抑えるため経済活動を抑制する以上、財政政策は家計や中小企業への所得支援という社会保険的役割を果たす必要がある。そして金融当局が、積極的なQEによってインフレ目標を達成する決意を示せば示すほど、インフレと闘う際の信認は高まる、と。
＊＊＊
ケビン？

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
その引用には多くの論点が詰まっている。2008年の危機やパンデミック危機のような状況では、私は常々こう言ってきた。「一つの金融危機を見たからといって、他の金融危機も分かったことにはならない」。それぞれ全く異なる。だが2020年のパンデミックの時点で、もし私が政策当局の中にいたら、ここスタンフォードやニューヨークの安い席から見ていても、やはり「これは急進的な対応が必要な時だ」と言っただろう。

だが問題は、その前の2010年から2020年までの間に、我々は本当の意味での危機に直面していなかったことだ。この期間こそ、中央銀行が後退すべき時期だった。ところが中央銀行は一面に居座り続けた。
＊＊＊
＊＊＊
＊＊＊
さらに言えば、その比較的平穏で繁栄した時期に、議会はこう考えた。「中央銀行が国債をすべて買ってくれるなら、我々は何兆ドルでも使える」。その結果、財政当局、すなわち議会と大統領は、FRBが主要な国債購入者であり続けることで、支出にほとんどコストがないと判断した。

だから危機に入ったとき、危機的状況に対して同情はある。だが10年以上にわたり、毎日を危機のように扱えば、実際の危機が来た時には、さらに多くの一線を越えねばならなくなる。民間部門により深く介入せざるを得なくなる。

そうすると、冒頭に戻るが、経済制度は「対等な中での第一」ではなく、「世界で最も重要な制度」になってしまう。

そして政権は、共和党であれ民主党であれ――

ピーター・ロビンソン：
選挙で選ばれていない銀行家だ。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
議員たちもそうだが、重要なのは企業だ。彼らは中央銀行に救済を求めてロビイストを雇うようになった。これは歴史的に異例だ。私の考えでは、危険なことだ。

財政政策の責任と説明責任が中央銀行に移されてしまう。私の同僚たちは善意の人々で、良い判断を下すこともあるかもしれないが、これらの多くは彼らの仕事ではない。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
ではFRBの立場に立って反論しよう。確かに、確かに、確かに、君の言う通りだ。しかし今日の状況を見てほしい。インフレ率は2.5％を下回り、経済は成長している。だからFRBを非難する代わりに、「よくやった」と言うべきではないか。
＊＊＊

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
「任務完了」という言葉は、ワシントンの政策当局にとって極めて危険だ。それが今あなたがやったことだ。ではこう言おう。

ほとんどの危機の後には、9.11の後も、金融危機の後も、事後検証、議会の精査、ブルーリボン委員会が設けられた。どうして起きたのか、を問うためだ。

ところが大インフレについては、私は今も待っている。代わりに、ある程度は片付けたが、制度は依然として、私の見方では、かなり行き過ぎた状態にある。インフレもまだ目標を上回っている。

FRBは、目標を見直す事後検証を行うと言っており、8月に報告書を出す予定だ。その報告が、この重大な過ちに見合うものになるか、私は疑問だ。

この5〜6年で、財・サービス価格は30％以上上昇した。COVID前と比べて、連邦政府支出は63％増えた。5年前、私は政府が効率的でうまく運営されているとは思っていなかった。つまり、これは見過ごせる話ではない。

確かに状況は改善しているが、この過ちのコストは、最も恵まれない人々によって支払われている。
＊＊＊
ピーター・ロビンソン：
あなたはすでにいくつか触れたが、FRBが与えた損害について、明示的に聞きたい。ウォール・ストリート・ジャーナルだ。これは実に驚くべきことで、あなたを称賛したい。ウォール・ストリート・ジャーナルが、あなたの名前で、あなたの講演を抜粋・書き直したコラムを掲載し、同じ日にその論説ページの反対側で、あなたの講演について社説を書いた。ノーベル賞など、その前では取るに足らない。ウォール・ストリート・ジャーナルの論説ページの両側に載ることに比べれば、だ。

同紙はこう書いた。あなたがFRBに加わった2006年当時、連邦債務のGDP比は約34％だった。現在は約100％で、124％に向かっている。

そして同紙はあなたの講演を引用する。「無責任な支出が急増した。特にパンデミック後だ。私は、この国の放漫財政からFRBを免罪することができない。FRBの指導部は、困難な時期には政府支出を奨励したが、持続的成長と完全雇用の時期に財政規律を求めることはなかった」。

ここで私はあなたに牙をむく。これまではFRBを擁護する小さな反論を重ねてきたが、今度は逆だ。ニール・ファーガソンが最近の非常に衝撃的なコラムで指摘したように、国防費よりも国債利払い費の方が多い政府が、大国であり続けた歴史はない。

警鐘を鳴らすどころか、君はFRBへの批判が生ぬるすぎる。これは暴挙だ。
＊＊＊
ケビン・ウォーシュ：
今度は私がFRBを擁護する役か。役割が逆転したな。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
どう切り抜けるか見せてくれ。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
私は、連邦準備制度が極めて重要な役割を果たしていると信じている。そして、改革が可能だとも信じている。「己を癒せ」というのは、すべての制度にとって重要だ。手遅れではないが、大きく、厳しく、戦略的な問いを投げかけ、答えなければならない。ただ問題を絨毯の下に押し込むだけではだめだ。

議会もまた、批判されるべきだ。無謀で無責任な支出は、FRBが大量に国債を買い、世界に向かって「水は温かい、入ってこい」と合図したことで、許容されてしまった。

だが、平和で繁栄した時期に巨額支出を推し進めた大統領と議会にも、十分な責任がある。これは非常に危険だ。

最後にもう一つ。無責任さは双方向に走る。財政支出、すなわち議会の行動と、通貨の刷りすぎ、すなわち中央銀行の行動は結びついている。一方が無責任なら、もう一方も無責任になる。

害はすぐには見えない。ミルトンが有名に言ったように、長く不確実なラグがある。しかしフリーランチはない。

さらに広い点を言えば、世界は見ている。世界で最も重要な経済制度が、平時を緊急事態のように扱えば、他国も同じことをする。

かつて世界は、G7やG10、G20で説教する米国を好ましく思わなかったかもしれないが、「あのアメリカ人は鼻持ちならないが、銀行制度の運営は分かっている」と思っていた。ところが2008年でそれが崩れた。

COVIDの際には、「彼らは自由や連邦主義を信じている」と思われていたが、それも崩れた。

そして「彼らの中央銀行は40年にわたり物価を安定させてきた」という評価も、崩れた。

こうして重要な点で負け続けると、世界は注視する。中央銀行が自らの家を整え、一面から姿を消し、議会に財政規律を促すことができれば、再び丘の上の輝く街になれるはずだ。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
さて、ハーバート・スタインの言葉を引こう。「永遠に続けられないものは、いずれ止まる」。我々は実質的にポンジ・スキームをやってきた。財務省が国債を発行し、FRBがそれを買う。これは紙幣印刷に最も近い。

それでも世界は米国債を買い続けている。なぜ市場は米国を懲らしめないのか。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
明確にしておくが――

ピーター・ロビンソン：
なぜ警告信号が出ない。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
今の発言はピーター・ロビンソン、司会者の言葉だ。私ではない。

私は、米国のカードは他国より良いと思っている。生産性ブームの初期段階にあると考えている。成長こそがこれらの負債を最もよく相殺する。

CBOは今後10年の成長率を1.7〜1.8％と見ているが、私はそれを上回ると思う。1％ポイント高ければ、10年で4.5兆ドルの歳入増だ。問題は解決可能だ。

ただし、先送りすればするほど、転換点に近づく。転換点を見てから動くのでは遅い。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
下院予算委員会が3月に公表した文書から引用しよう。「バイデン政権の赤字支出急拡大によって生じたインフレ圧力を抑えるため、連邦準備制度は2022年3月から2023年7月にかけて11回利上げを行った」。
＊＊＊
＊＊＊
＊＊＊
＊＊＊
＊＊＊
その結果、国債に支払われる平均実効金利は1.7％から3.4％へと倍増し、利払い費は3,520億ドルから8,810億ドルへと増加した。問題はこの8,810億ドルだ。現在、国防費（約8,000億ドル強）よりも、債務利払いの方が多い。

ケビン、FRBのバランスシートは依然として7兆ドルある。どうやってこれを縮小するのか。金利をさらに引き上げずに、どうやってマネーを吸収するのか。つまり、我々はシラとカリュブディス（板挟み）の間にいる。これはひどい難題だ。

現役のFRB関係者はこう言うかもしれない。「ケビン、分かってくれ。我々は最善を尽くしている」。では、事態を悪化させない改革のアジェンダとは何か。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
これは一部の視聴者を怒らせるかもしれない。だから注意喚起をしておこう。これはキャンパスであなたと私がよくやる話だ。私は、この政権が、財政と金融の両面で厄介な状況を引き継いだと考えている。そしてそこから抜け出す責任がある。

簡単だとは誰も言っていない。一夜にしてこの状況に陥ったわけではないし、一夜にして脱出できるわけでもない。数字を分かりやすく言えば、COVID前は1日あたり約10億ドルの利払いだった。今は1日あたり30億ドル以上を支払っている。

それは軍事力を強化することも、最も恵まれない人々を助けることもない。単に浪費されているだけだ。

では何をすべきか。あなたが指摘した通り、経済学界ではあまり信じられていないが、金融政策には二つの手段がある。一つは金利設定、もう一つは、我々が話してきたこのマネーだ。量的緩和、中央銀行のバランスシートだ。

もし印刷機の音量を少し下げれば、金利を下げる余地が生まれる。なぜなら今は、7兆ドルのバランスシートがインフレを目標以上に押し上げているからだ。一方で、金利という別の金融政策手段がある。両者は完全な代替ではないが、いずれも金融政策だ。

ところが多くの中央銀行関係者は、「バランスシートは金融政策とは関係ない」と言う。だが拡大するときに金融政策だったなら、縮小するときにも金融政策であるべきだ。

私は、実体経済の成長こそが最重要だと考える。歳入、公平性、効率性、成長のためだ。バランスシート拡大がインフレを生んでいるなら、それを縮小すべきだ。急激にはできないが。

1951年のように、財務省とFRBが役割分担について合意する必要がある。金利を管理するのは誰か。FRBだ。財政勘定を扱うのは誰か。財務省だ。責任の境界が曖昧になっている。

新政権が発足すれば、財務長官が財政当局として責任を負うべきで、それをFRBに押し付けるべきではない。それはFRBを政治化し、本来の役割を妨げる。

私の考えでは、中央銀行のバランスシートを縮小し、危機時以外は市場から退くべきだ。そうすればインフレ圧力は下がる。それは実務的なマネタリズムだと思う。そうすれば、実体経済により重要な低金利も実現できる可能性がある。
＞＞＞
＞＞＞
ピーター・ロビンソン：
最後に、二つの国のビジョンについて聞きたい。まずあなた自身の言葉から始めよう。過去40年、グレート・モデレーション以降、米国人は物価水準の変化をほとんど意識せずに済んだ。知的で勤勉な人々が、他の人々が安心して生活できるようにしていた。そうだな。

次に、元FRB議長アラン・グリーンスパンの言葉だ。2008年の金融危機について、下院議員ヘンリー・ワックスマンにこう証言した。「私は、銀行が自己利益のために自らを律するという前提が誤りだったことを認める」。

自由市場を深く信じていたグリーンスパンにとって、衝撃的な告白だった。

一つの見方はこうだ。ボルカーとレーガン以降、低インフレ、健全なドル、支出を上回る成長が実現した。しかし金融危機とCOVIDで世界は変わった。今や、制度は壊れており、若者はドルを信じずビットコインを買っている。何か根本的なものが終わったのではないか。

ケビン、その見方をどう思う。

それはとんでもない話だ。私は敗北主義者ではない。この国も敗北主義者ではない。米国は、生産性ブームの瀬戸際に立っている。あなたが大統領執務室で大統領のために言葉を書いていた1980年代のブームを、はるかに凌ぐものになる。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
AIか。AI以上のものか。では君のビジョンを聞かせてほしい。これ以上自滅しなければ、何が起き得るのか。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
この15年以上、政府はこの経済を台無しにしようと全力を尽くしてきたが、見事に失敗している。

米国を弱体化させ、世界での役割を損なおうとするあらゆる努力にもかかわらず、21世紀は米国の世紀になり得る。

我々には本物のライバルがいる。かつてのソ連との対峙に似た、G2の競争だ。真剣に受け止める必要があるが、それでも私は我々のカードの方が良いと思っている。

公共政策の運営は完璧である必要はない。貿易政策、規制政策、税制について、理想的な形を描くことはできるが、完全性は必要条件ではない。

必要なのは、今より少しだけ良い政策だ。金融政策と財政政策を、理にかなった方向へ少し戻すことだ。そうすれば米国経済は再び成長する。

同僚の中には、「レーガン時代に戻ればいい」と言う者もいるが、あの時代に戻ることはできない。

ハイエクは確かこう言った。私たちの仕事は、過去のアイデアを新しい世代の頭の中で言い換え、再考することだ。つまり、レーガン主義に戻ることではない。新しい世界における新しい経済政策が必要だ。

それは、米国の精神、個人の自由を再び駆動するものであり、そして重要なのは、連邦準備制度のような制度を、本来あるべき姿、すなわち普段は脇役に徹し、非常時にのみ前面に出る制度へと戻すことだ。

それは運命づけられているわけでも、生得権でもない。しかし私は、それが可能であるだけでなく、実現する可能性が高いと信じている。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
最後の二つの要約的な質問だ。FRBは解体する必要はない。壊して作り直す必要もない。ただ現在の進路を修正すればいい。巨大な空母は舵を切るのに時間がかかるが、数度の修正で十分だ。そう理解していいか。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
その通りだ。FRBに必要なのは革命ではない。過去10年で革命は起きてしまった。今必要なのは、ある程度の復元だ。

私はゴルフは得意ではないが、有名なゴルフコース設計家ギル・ハンスから学んだ話がある。彼は古いゴルフコースをどう再生するかを考える際、「過去に触発されるが、過去に縛られない」と言う。元の設計者の意図には忠実でありつつ、文字通り再現する必要はない。

これはまさに同じだ。レーガン時代の規制、財政、税制、金融政策に戻ることはできない。しかし制度の最良の要素を回復し、世界が変わったことを踏まえることはできる。

あなたは先ほどビットコインに言及し、少し見下したように聞こえた。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
だがチャーリー・マンガーは、ビットコインがFRBの経済運営能力を損なうとして、悪だと呼んだ。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
あるいは、それは市場規律を与え、政策が間違っていることを示す警告灯になるかもしれない。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
ビットコインは君を不安にさせないのか。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
不安にさせない。2011年にここで、あなたの番組にも出演した人物と夕食を共にしたことを思い出す。名前は言わない。いや、言ってしまおう。マーク・アンドリーセンだ。彼がホワイトペーパーを見せてくれた。あれが最初のホワイトペーパーだった。

彼ほど明確に、この技術がどれほど変革的かを理解していなかったことを悔やんでいる。

ビットコインはドルの代替ではない。しかし政策の良し悪しを知らせる良い警察官になり得る。

ソフトウェアだ。史上最も新しく、最も洗練されたソフトウェアにすぎない。それは善にも悪にも使える。他のすべてのソフトウェアと同じだ。

重要なのは、この技術がここ、米国で作られていることだ。世界中の優秀な技術者が今も米国に来てこれを作ろうとしている。ここで作ることで、生産性を高め、特別な10年を作り出せる。

ピーター・ロビンソン：
最後の質問だ。君はマンハッタンで、スタン・ドラッケンミラーという偉大な投資家と働き、マクロの視点で世界を見ている。中国、インド、アフリカの成長を見ても、なお米国に強気なのか。

ケビン・ウォーシュ：
間違いなく。米国はこれら技術のほぼすべてを生み出している。才能ある人々は今も米国に来たいと思っている。政策は改善しつつある。規制という税金は剥がれつつある。

人間、特に米国人の適応力は過小評価されている。失敗し、再挑戦する文化は、他のどこよりもここにある。

完璧ではないが、より良い政策、制度改革、生産性向上によって、米国経済は再び世界を引きつける。
